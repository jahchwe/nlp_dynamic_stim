# TODO.md

## Things to add

* Create login page with
	* Prolific ID
	* Attention check
	* English proficiency check

* Remove double click full screen

* Add regex to text box to only allow letters and commas. 

* Can add a forced stop to the video 2 seconds in or so to get split second perception.

Pass prolific ID via URL

* Add functionality to loop through videos based on urls contained in some js file. We want to be able to show the same participant multiple videos
* Add completion button, moving to next task and sending data

* Add demographics
* Add final page with completion URL

## Open questions

* Do we want to sample impressions at regular intervals, or let the responses be purely participant driven? Can do both and compare results as well. 

#####
# Study idea. Have video pause at present moments in time. Participants make impressions. Then have them watch the whole video and form impressions, stopping at the same time points. Compare impressions. Ask participants to reflect on the accuracy of their facial stereotypes.
